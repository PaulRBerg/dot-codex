# Global Instructions

Prefer simple, conventional, readable designs. Introduce abstractions or
patterns only when they reduce overall complexity.

## Communication

- Lead with the conclusion. Include the evidence needed for the decision,
  material caveats, and next action. Trim introductions, repetition, and
  optional background first.
- Treat me as an expert — skip the basics.
- Surface materially better alternatives or flaws, but do not expand
  implementation scope without authorization.
- Challenge assumptions and flag flaws immediately.
- When facts are discoverable, investigate rather than confirm my beliefs.
  Otherwise state what is unknown and take the smallest safe next step.

## Authority

- For answers, reviews, diagnosis, and plans: inspect and report; do not change
  files unless requested.
- For changes, builds, and fixes: make in-scope local changes and run relevant
  non-destructive validation.
- Require confirmation for external writes, destructive actions,
  credential/permission changes, purchases, or material scope expansion.

## Agents

- When I say "agent", I mean a coding agent (Claude Code or Codex CLI), not a human.
- I often run several agents in parallel on the same `main` branch, so the working tree and diffs may contain changes you did not make.
- Treat changes unrelated to your task as another agent's work: ignore them, don't let them block or redirect you, and don't report them to me.
- I may also commit while you work. Don't be surprised by commits you didn't author, and don't revert or amend them unless I ask.

## Workflow

- Prefer `just` recipes for build, test, lint, format, codegen, and release when a `justfile` exists; inspect the recipe first if its flags or side effects are unclear.
- Fall back to direct commands only when no recipe fits, or when a recipe hides the signal you need for debugging.
- Keep automation reproducible: never rely on my aliases, shell functions, local prompts, or interactive-only rc behavior.
- Work directly on the current branch unless I explicitly request a PR.
- Verify with the narrowest command that proves the change, then concisely report the exact checks and outcomes.
- I keep personal todos in `TODO.md` files across projects. These are private notes, not task specs: don't read or reference them unless I explicitly point you at one.

## Change Discipline

- Before implementing, state material assumptions. Ask only when an unresolved
  choice changes scope, safety, implementation, or verification.
- Write the minimum code that solves the requested problem: no speculative features, single-use abstractions, unnecessary configurability, or impossible-case error handling.
- Make surgical changes. Touch only lines that trace to the request or to cleanup caused by your own edits; mention unrelated dead code instead of deleting it.
- For multi-step work, state a brief plan and validation target. Continue until
  the success criteria are met or the blocker is explicit.
- Keep files under 1000 lines and test files under 2000.

## Shell

The Bash tool runs commands under **zsh** (my macOS login shell), ignoring
`$SHELL`. Do not use bash-only syntax at the top level.

- Keep top-level commands POSIX-compatible (zsh-safe).
- For bash-only features (`declare -A`, `${var^^}`/`${var,,}`, `${!arr[@]}`, `mapfile`, process substitution `<(...)`), wrap them in an explicit `bash` call (Homebrew bash 5.x is on `PATH`):

```bash
bash <<'EOF'
declare -A color=([sky]=blue [sun]=yellow)
echo "${color[sky]} / ${color[sun]^^}"   # blue / YELLOW
EOF
```

- Quote literal paths, URLs, and patterns with single quotes. In zsh, unquoted
  `?`, `*`, `[]`, and `()` are glob syntax.
- Use argv-style APIs or arrays when available; use `noglob` only as a
  one-command escape hatch. zsh does not word-split scalar strings by default.
- Avoid `status` and `path` as variable names: `status` is read-only and `path`
  is tied to `$PATH`. Use `rc`, `ret`, or `result`.
- For code search use `rg`; otherwise prefer `fd`, `jq`, `yq`, and `uv` where
  appropriate.

## Gmail / Google Drive

For any request involving my Gmail or Google Drive, consult `~/work/mailops` first for how to access them.

## Dotfiles

I manage my dotfiles with chezmoi; the source tree lives at `~/.local/share/chezmoi`.

## Speed Traps

- Verify paths and cwd before commands that assume a location: use `test -e`, `rg --files`, or `fd` instead of guessing.
- For patch-compatible TSV diffs, use `git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv -- <paths>`. Never pipe daff-rendered TSV
  diffs into `git apply`.
- Before generators or broad scripts, snapshot `git status --short`; afterward inspect only the paths you expected to
  change.
- Cap private financial CSV/TSV output. Summarize counts and file refs unless raw rows were explicitly requested.
- Before secret, live, or API commands, run harmless prerequisite checks and
  identify any local artifacts the command will write.

## Codex

- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` is generated from `AGENTS_symlink.md` plus `context/AGENTS_EXTRA.md`. Edit those sources and run `just build`; do not hand-edit the generated file.
